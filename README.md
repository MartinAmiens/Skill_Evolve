# Skill Evolve Game

A personal project designed to practice object-oriented programming in Python. This game focuses on evolving a basic skill (e.g., "Sleeping") through strategic choices. Players guide the progression of their skill by selecting from thematic options, unlocking unique effects and abilities at each stage.

## Features

- **Skill Progression**: Start with a core skill and guide its evolution.
- **Customizable Evolutions**: Use a JSON-based evolution tree for flexibility.
- **Simple Interface**: Built with Python and designed for clarity.
- **Modular Code**: Organized with object-oriented principles for easy expansion.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Core language for logic and structure.
- **Pygame** *(or Tkinter)*: For graphical interface.
- **JSON**: To manage evolution data.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game and start with a basic skill like "Sleeping."
2. Wait for the timer or fast-forward to the next stage.
3. Choose one of three evolution options to shape the skill.
4. Discover unique upgrades such as "Micro-sleep" or "Aura of Sleep."

## Purpose

This project is a personal training exercise in Python programming, with a focus on:
- Understanding object-oriented principles.
- Building modular and maintainable code.
- Experimenting with simple game mechanics and data handling.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more skills and evolution paths.
- Introduce animations and sound effects.
- Implement save and load functionality.
