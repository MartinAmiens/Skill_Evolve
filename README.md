# Skill Evolve Game

A personal project designed to practice object-oriented programming in Python. This game focuses on evolving a basic skill (e.g., "Sleeping") through strategic choices. Players guide the progression of their skill by selecting from thematic options, unlocking unique effects and abilities at each stage.

## Features

- **Skill Progression**: Start with a core skill and guide its evolution.
- **Customizable Evolutions**: Use a JSON-based evolution tree for flexibility.
- **Simple Interface**: Built with Python and designed for clarity.
- **Modular Code**: Organized with object-oriented principles for easy expansion.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Core language for logic and structure.
- **Tkinter**: Used for the graphical interface.
- **JSON**: To manage evolution data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended). If Tkinter is not included in your Python installation, install it accordingly.

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MartinAmiens/Skill_Evolve/edit/main/README.md
cd skill-evolve-game
```

### Install Dependencies

Install all required packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Game

```sh
python main.py
```

## How to Play

1. Launch the game by running `python main.py`.
2. The initial skill (e.g., "Sleeping") is displayed.
3. Click the **"Ã‰voluer"** button to see available evolution choices.
4. Select an evolution to upgrade your skill.
5. Continue evolving until no more choices are available.

## Purpose

This project is a personal training exercise in Python programming, with a focus on:

- Understanding object-oriented principles.
- Building modular and maintainable code.
- Experimenting with simple game mechanics and data handling.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more skills and evolution paths.
- Introduce animations and sound effects.
- Implement save and load functionality.
